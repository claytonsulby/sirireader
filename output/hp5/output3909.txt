 Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else ing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, be- ably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s cause he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s all very mixed up and painful.
