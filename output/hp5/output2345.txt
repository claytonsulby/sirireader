 Best,     Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading   PERCY AND PADFOOT this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up rectly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.
