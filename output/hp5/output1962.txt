 “You are so tactless!” “What? I only asked her if —” “Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”    PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE “So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —” “What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for?” “Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —” “Who cares if she supports the Tornados?” “Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season —” “But what does it matter?” “It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the bandwagon —” “That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two flect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’ conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country. And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric’s death.
