 A long line of scared-looking first years   entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizardâ€™s hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim. The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then fessor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.
