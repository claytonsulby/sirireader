Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away —” Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and tened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing — “— dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re singing?” And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands:    THE LION AND THE SERPENT Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring, That’s why Slytherins all sing: Weasley is our King.
