 Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats  DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY that Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured. “Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face.
