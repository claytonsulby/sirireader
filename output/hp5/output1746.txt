 When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagridâ€™s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness.

The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first.
