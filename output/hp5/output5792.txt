 Snape remained close by, still buried in his examination questions; but this was Snapeâ€™s memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a   different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any farther. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.
