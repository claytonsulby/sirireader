  The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven oâ€™clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, ditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass.

They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying.
